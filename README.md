# Module3.1-SASS
I watched the tutorial videos nr. 1 - 8 that Siggi posted on Slack. I did all of the coding in the video step by step. Then played around with the code afterwards and changed it.
1. Compiled SASS - Created a SASS code and compiled into CSS
2. installed gulp
3. Watch files with SASS
4. Used Varibles
5. Used Partials and @import
6. Structured the Projects
7. Used Nested Rules
8. Used Math //@debug math.div(10,3); ...and more
9. Used Maps //@debug map-get($colors, "purple"); ...and more

The site is not the prettiest but did not want to complicate it.
