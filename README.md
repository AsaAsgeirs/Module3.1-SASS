# Module3.1-SASS
I watched the tutorial videos nr. 1 - 8 that Siggi posted on Slack. I did all of the coding in the video step by step. Then played around with the code afterwards and changed it.
1. I compiled SASS
2. Used Varibles
3. Used Partials and @import
4. Structured the Projects
5. Used Nested Rules
6. Used Math //@debug math.div(10,3); ...and more
7. Used Maps //@debug map-get($colors, "purple"); ...and more

The site is not the prettiest but did not want to complicate it.
